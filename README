I realized recently that roguelikes are my favorite genre of video games.  All
the ones I've played are very fun.  Also I realized that the only reason I
wanted to make Intelligence a sidescroller was that the animations were that
way, but that was because of the style of ASCIImator, not a decision of mine.
So I realized it was time for me to start making decisions on my own, and now
we have...
